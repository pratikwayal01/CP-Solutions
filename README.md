## Introduction

LeetCode is a great platform for preparing for coding interviews and improving your problem-solving skills. 
This repository is a record of my progress and solutions to the problems I have solved on LeetCode. Feel free to browse through the solutions and use them as a reference.

## Languages Used

- C++

## Directory Structure
(Repo is not sorted yet but after sorting it will look something like this)
The repository is organized as follows:

â”œâ”€â”€ Easy
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem1.cpp
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem2.cpp
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Medium
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem1.cpp
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem2.cpp
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Hard
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem1.cpp
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem2.cpp
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ README.md


Each directory (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`) contains solutions to problems of the corresponding difficulty level. Each file is named according to the problem title or ID on LeetCode.
